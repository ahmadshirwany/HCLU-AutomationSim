# HCLU-AutomationSim
Hardening Crate Loading and Unloading Cell

This repository contains the Visual Components simulation project for automating crate assembly, loading, and unloading processes using a robotic cell. The simulation demonstrates a step-by-step workflow designed to achieve efficiency, precision, and adaptability in dynamic manufacturing environments.

## Features  
- *Workflow Simulation*: Includes stages like preparation, base assembly, layer assembly, and final assembly.  
- *Gripper and Flange Design*: Tailored tools for handling bolts, spacers, plates, and pistons.  
- *Dynamic Operation*: Adaptability to changes in rod alignment and handling precision through vision system integration.  

## Project Structure  
- Models/: 3D models of crates, pistons, and assembly components.  
- Grippers/: CAD designs of custom grippers for the simulation.  
- Workflow/: Visual Components simulation files demonstrating the automated process.  
- Documentation/: Detailed project workflow and challenges encountered.  
- Video/: Sample Video of visual representations of the simulation.  

## Prerequisites  
To run this simulation, you will need:  
- Visual Components Premium or Essentials  
- Basic knowledge of robotic simulations and Visual Components interface
